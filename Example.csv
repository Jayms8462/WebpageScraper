From New York Times bestselling author and 15-time GRAMMY(R) Award-winning artist Alicia Keys comes a new authentic and poignant coming-of-age young adult graphic novel, about finding the strength within when your whole world changes in an instant. Lolo Wright always thought she was just a regular fourteen-year-old dealing with regular family drama: her brother, James, is struggling with his studies; her dad's business constantly teeters on the edge of trouble; and her mother . . . she left long ago. But then Lolo's world explodes when a cop pulls a gun on James in a dangerous case of mistaken identities. Staring down the barrel, with no one else to help, Lolo discovers powers she never knew she had. Using only her mind, she literally throws the cop out of the way. Problem is that secrets like Lolo's don't stay a secret for long. Skin, a dangerous dealer with designs on taking over the neighborhood, hears of Lolo's telekinetic abilities and decides that he needs her in his crew. Skin might not have Lolo's powers, but he's got nothing to lose and is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants. And what he wants is Lolo. Lolo's not willing to let Skin use her to hurt the people--and neighborhood--that she loves. But it's going to take a whole different kind of bravery to stand-up for what's right, especially after Lolo's mom returns suddenly and turns Lolo's whole world upside-down. For too long, it's true, Lolo's had her head in the clouds, but this time, it's on her . . . and she's not backing down. Girl on Fire is a young adult graphic novel about a girl who's a flame. It's the first-ever graphic novel from beloved GRAMMY(R) Award-winning artist Alicia Keys, co-written by Andrew Weiner and illustrated by Brittney Williams.

Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called the Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be.

The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde's only novel and one of the classics of gothic literature, is the tale of the most beautiful man of his age, who sells his soul and his conscience in exchange for eternal youth, beauty and power -- and who spends his life murdering, raping and corrupting. All the time in his attic, his picture degrades and rots. GRAY takes that basic idea but flips its moral framework and gender archetypes: our DORIAN GRAY is a Millennial social media princess who drifts through the coolest cliques of NYC, breaking hearts and turning heads wherever she goes. But Dorian has secrets. For one thing, she's a violent criminal. For another, she's an immortal creature of magic, who commits violent burglaries and assaults some of New York's most powerful men. 30 years ago, whilst an innocent student, Dorian was sexually assaulted by these men. In that moment that she became something both more and less than human. 30 years later, but not a day older, she's ready for her revenge. Then Dorian meets Detective HANK WUTAN, the African-American NYPD detective assigned to stop these crimes, struggling with his own loyalties as a Black cop in the era of Defund the Police. Despite the fact that Dorian is his suspect number one, and he is effectively working for her abusers, they fall for each other, hard. GRAY takes Wilde's classic novel and reinvents it as a tale of cathartic revenge for the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter era, a violent fantasy about how powerful, super-rich white men don't always win, how the powerless can find justice, and about how a murderous demon and a law-abiding detective can be soul mates.

These fears motivated civic organizations and major comic book companies to team up and create beautifully drawn comic books with clever stories to be passed out in the streets, in union halls, in factories, at state fairs, in schools, in churches--wherever people gathered. There were titles like ""The Man Who Stole Your Vote"" (with an evil masked super villain), ""If Your Children Could Vote"" (with a brave, brash Greta Thurnberg-of-the-time berating the adults), and ""Your Vote is Vital"" (powerfully illustrated by Lee Elias!).

The 1960s Civil Rights-era had the NAACP behind a historically important, engaging comic book ""The Street Where You Live"" to motivatee blacks to get to the polls (drawn by pioneering black artist Tom Feelings). There is historical evidence that this is an unknown Marvel comic!

These comic books warned citizens to be on the alert for political corruption and get out and vote to stop it! These lost and priceless comic books are beautifully restored and reprinted in full in this fascinating edition. Multiple-Eisner Award winner Craig Yoe provides a revealing introduction profusely illustrated with photos and rare cartoons.

Jayel Draco’s gorgeous illustrations present a vivid picture of elaborate cityscapes and mountain vistas, vast skyfaring fleets, and fantastic flora and fauna.

When she discovers that this raccoon can talk, the two become instant friends, and Nikola (that’s the raccoon) moves in with the lonely Tracy.

""The Flintstones"" tickled America's funny bone, touched its heart, and took the world by storm. No other show ever has been so instantly and universally popular: Fred's exultant ""Yabba-Dabba-Doo"" has been heard in more than eighty languages, and Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera, the cocreators of the show, proudly proclaim, ""Every hour of every day, someone somewhere in the world is watching 'The Flintstones'.""

Join the creative minds behind Bedrock - including the writers, artists, and actors who provided the voices of everyone's favorite Stone Age family - as they recall the earliest days of the show. From Joe Barbera's weeks of struggle selling the show to its sudden and unexpected cancellation, the history of ""The Flintstones"" is chronicled within these pages.
But The Flintstones: A Modern Stone Age Phenomenon presents more than just the original TV series. Riding the wave of the show's popularity were numerous spin-offs, television specials, and two big-screen movies. And while viewers were eagerly awaiting the next installment of prehistoric animation, they could eat, drink, and wear Flintstones merchandise. From grape juice to cigarettes, Fred and Wilma have endorsed and sold it all.

Illustrating this definitive examination of ""The Flintstones"" are never-before-published concept sketches, images from the unseen pilot show ""The Flagstones,"" rare cel art, and unique memorabilia. And completing a truly comprehensive account of the show that made television prehistory is an appendix that contains episode descriptions of the original 166 shows - including original air and recording dates, as well as writer, director, and voice actor information.

The first-ever full reckoning with Marvel Comics' interconnected, half-million-page story, a revelatory guide to the ""epic of epics""--and to the past 60 years of American culture--from a beloved authority on the subject who read all 27,000+ Marvel superhero comics and lived to tell the tale. The superhero comic books that Marvel Comics has published since 1961 are, Douglas Wolk notes, the longest continuous, self-contained work of fiction ever created: over half a million pages to date, and growing. The Marvel story is a gigantic mountain, smack in the middle of contemporary culture. Thousands of writers and artists have contributed to it. Every schoolchild recognizes its protagonists: Spider-Man, the Avengers, the X-Men. 18 of the 100 highest-grossing movies of all time are directly based on parts of it. And not even the people telling the story have read the whole thing--nobody's supposed to. So, of course, that's what Wolk did: he read all 27,000 comics that make up the Marvel universe thus far, from Alpha Flight to Omega the Unknown. And then he made sense of it: seeing into the ever-expanding story, in its parts and as a coherent whole, and seeing through it, as a prism through which to view the landscape of American culture. In Wolk's hands, the mammoth Marvel narrative becomes a funhouse-mirror history of the past 60 years, from the atomic night-terrors of the Cold War to the technocracy and political division of the present day--a boisterous, tragicomic, magnificently filigreed epic about power and ethics, set in a world transformed by wonders. As a work of cultural exegesis, this is sneakily significant, even a landmark; it's also ludicrously fun. Looking over close to sixty years of Marvel's comics, Wolk sees fascinating patterns -- the rise and fall of particular cultural aspirations, and of the storytelling modes that conveyed them. He observes the Marvel story's progressive visions and its painful stereotypes, its patches of woeful hackwork and stretches of luminous creativity, and the way they all feed into a potent cosmology that echoes our deepest hopes and fears. This is a huge treat for Marvel fans, but it's also a revelation for readers who don't know Doctor Strange from Doctor Doom. Here, truly, are all of the marvels.

Dieter Lumpen is a man of the world, an adventurer who wants no part of adventure. Nonetheless, he is swept along to exotic locations from Turkey to the Caribbean, from China to Venice. He is not quite so hard-boiled as the typical adventure hero. As written by Zentner, Dieter's irony is gentler, more subtle, more reflective, and more tongue-in-cheek than hard or bitter. Pellejero is quite simply one of Europe's top comics artists, who was chosen for the plum job to illustrate the new adventures of Hugo Pratt's Corto Maltese. Dieter Lumpen began in 1981 and continued until 1994.

This definitive omnibus collects all eight short stories and the three graphic novels with a foreword by Tim Sale.

See how depictions of aliens have evolved over the years in popular and pulp magazines, comics, on TV, and in movies! Readers will meet aliens with eyes on stalks, robot aliens (as in H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds), barrel chested aliens (as per Frank R. Paul's Martian of the 1930s), blob-like B-movie aliens of the 1950s, ""realistic"" aliens as featured in the 1977 movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind (supposedly based on the real alien found at Roswell), monstrous aliens such as H.R. Giger's creature in Ridley Scott's 1979 movie Alien, the friendly alien (a thin creature with hands and a tortoise-like head) that's the ""hero"" of Spielberg's 1982 movie, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, aerial predator aliens with giant wings (as created by Wayne Barlow for his book Expedition, in 1990)--and many more. Whether friendly visitor or fearsome invader, we learn that both the motive for, and method of, invasion has often been influenced by the social mood and politics of the era in which the magazine, comic, or movie was published or released. As for aliens' chosen method of invasion... not all aliens use ray guns to invade. Instead they employ ""seed pods,"" mind control, and body transference--just a few of the alternative methods used by aliens to invade the minds and bodies of humans, thus bending them to their submission. Visualized through the prism of pop culture in this thoroughly engaging 176-page book, which features more than 200 full-color illustrations, all of which are accompanied by extensive captions. Beginning with an overview of the Alien Invasion genre and continuing through nine chapters filled with the most insightful nuggets of information and eye-popping graphics this side of the Van Allen radiation belt.

Judge these books by their covers! Get immersed in the definitive visual history of pulp fiction paperbacks from 1940 to 1970. The Art of Pulp Fiction: An Illustrated History of Vintage Paperbacks chronicles the history of pocket-sized paperbound books designed for mass-market consumption, specifically concentrating on the period from 1940 to 1970. These three decades saw paperbacks eclipse cheap pulp magazines and expensive clothbound books as the most popular delivery vehicle for escapist fiction. To catch the eyes of potential buyers they were adorned with covers that were invariably vibrant, frequently garish, and occasionally lurid. Today the early paperbacks--like the earlier pulps, inexpensively produced and considered disposable by casual readers--are treasured collector's items. Award-winning editor Ed Hulse (The Art of the Pulps and The Blood 'n' Thunder Guide to Pulp Fiction) comprehensively covers the pulp-fiction paperback's heyday. Hulse writes the individual chapter introductions and the captions, while a team of genre specialists and art aficionados contribute the special features included in each chapter. These focus on particularly important authors, artists, publishers, and sub-genres. Illustrated with more than 500 memorable covers and original cover paintings. Hulse's extensive captions, meanwhile, offer a running commentary on this significant genre, and also contain many obscure but entertaining factoids. Images used in The Art of Pulp Fiction have been sourced from the largest American paperback collections in private hands, and have been curated with rarity in mind, as well as graphic appeal. Consequently, many covers are reproduced here for the first time since the books were first issued. With an overall Introduction by Richard A. Lupoff, novelist, essayist, pop-culture historian, and author of The Great American Paperback (2001).

Newly expanded and updated, this beautiful coffee table book delves into the 40-year relationship between Rush and their longtime artist and illustrator, with a foreword by drummer and lyricist Neil Peart! Containing original illustrations, paintings, photography, and the incredible stories behind each album that Hugh Syme has designed with the band since 1975. The book's narration was written by music journalist Stephen Humphries and includes in-depth interviews with each Rush band member and the artist. The Art of Rush also contains entertaining anecdotes and commentary from a wide array of notable musicians, actors, athletes, writers, radio personalities, and Rush insiders about their favorite Rush album covers, which clearly reveals how vital and impactful the visual representation of their music has been through the years. One of the hallmark's of Rush releases is the considerable care and consideration that goes into each one--including the conceptual artwork. Readers may be surprised to discover just how much effort went into each concept and the execution for every album cover! Some of the regaled stories include furtively crossing the border for a guerilla-style shoot for A Farewell to Kings, trying to herd a warren of rabbits for the cover of Presto, descending into the depths of an autopsy lab to find a brain for Hemispheres, and a stunt involving fire, whiskey, and photographer Deborah Samuel for Moving Pictures. But no history of the band's art would be complete without the story of the creation of arguably the band's most iconic image, The Starman from 2112. ""From the first time Hugh and I met, we shared a level of communication that would sustain us through all the years of discussing art by long distance,"" says Rush's Neil Peart.

This thick, full-color, 368-page hardback tome, in addition to exhuming every one of Gross' wild and crazy comic book stories, shares rare photos, sketches, and unpublished art, including the previously unknown cover to the Milt Gross Funnies #3!

It is here that we also meet the young and beautiful Pandora, her brother Cain, the mysterious criminal mastermind Monk, the grim and ferocious Rasputin, Lieutenant Slutter of the German Navy, and the natives Skull and Tarao. The Ballad of the Salty Sea is also hailed as the first example of the literary comic strip. Pratt was inspired by Conrad, Stevenson, and London, but even more directly by Henry de Vere Stacpool's Blue Lagoon, from which the author got the idea of a small island in the Pacific which he named ""Escondida.""

After the runaway success of Giant Size X-Men #1, the title began producing all-new stories with X-Men #94… and the rest is the stuff comic book dreams are made of!

This Artifact Edition contains more than 100 pages from Cockrum's initial run on X-Men, as well as some pages when the artist returned later for a second run on the characters several years later. As with all Artist's Edition style books from IDW Publishing (which have so far won six Eisner Awards), the pages presented were all scanned from Cockrum's actual original art and are printed at the same size they were drawn, mimicking the look and feel of the artist's hand-drawn work. As an added bonus, there is a gallery section featuring covers, sketches, and a few surprises-this is an art book MADE for fans of Dave Cockrum's X-Men art!

And there's the hot Daisy Mae-look-alike, Clarabelle, in the hillbilly hi-jinks stories of her beau, Looey Lazybones (Holy Li'l Abner!). The introduction is by the famed cartoon director Ralph Bakshi who well knew Frazetta and closely worked with him when they co-produced the animated feature film, 'Fire and Ice.'

In Gangsters & Goliaths by John Layman and Alberto Ponticelli, Detective Makoto Sato is on a quest to bring down the Takahashi crime syndicate but Sato's efforts earn him a one-way trip to a tropical getaway, courtesy of the Tokyo criminal underworld--MONSTER ISLAND! Alone and facing death at the hands of both gangsters and goliaths, Sato must use his wits to survive--and enlist the aid of some unusual friends. In Cataclysm by Cullen Bunn and Dave Wachter, years have passed since a monster apocalypse nearly destroyed mankind. Now it is merely a distant, nightmarish memory for Hiroshi, an elder in one of the few remaining tribes of humans. Little does Hiroshi know that the apocalypse is not over, and that his memories of the past may yet save the future! In Oblivion by Joshua Fialkov and Brian Churilla, a scientist has created a portal to another dimension--one where monsters rule supreme! An expedition begins into a world where hope has died and Godzilla is the unrivaled King of the Monsters.

Ugh, all these nervous feelings! Will she fit in? Will she make new friends? Will they still like her once they get to know her better? Nope. For now the best she can manage is... awkward. This is not going great. That's when she sees it. Something dark and scary... something only she can see. And she should be scared. But she isn't. Maybe scary things just need friends, too. Maybe The Glim isn't so bad after all. The Girl and The Glim is about accepting the fact that fear is okay, and that while letting other people see your vulnerabilities can be scary, it can also lead to closer friendships in the end.

The Goats Getters also captures early twentieth century-history through the lens of the newspaper comics: the landmark 1910 boxing match in Reno, Nevada between Jim Jeffries, the ""Great White Hope,"" and Jack Johnson, the first African-American heavyweight champion; the nationwide race riots that followed; the San Francisco graft trials that culminated in the shooting of the Federal Prosecutor; and the trial of Harry Thaw for the murder of architect Stanford White, a crime of passion that centered on Thaw's wife, show-girl Evelyn Nesbitt Thaw-all were venerated or vilified by Nell Brinkley, Jimmy Swinnerton, and their fellow directors of the ink and newsprint stage.

In this dystopian swamp city, two brothers find that opportunity and exploitation lurk around every corner. But who's smarter: the hordes of people rushing to move in, or the equal horde desperate to leave? Penn and Lipton Wise have set out to Falter City to make their fortune. It's the future, obviously, and things are pretty grim. The Australian landscape is traumatized. Plague is rampant. Machines only work as well as the poor sod pedaling them. Things are hotter and wetter than they used to be, giving the whole place the vibe of a sweaty armpit. Lippy and Penn are hoping to set up shop in this grimy boom-town, but they've got to stay frosty, because it's teeming with hustlers, swindlers, and scoundrels. It's the sort of place where a lucky moron could make an outrageous fortune in an afternoon and lose it all before bedtime. The sort of place where two enterprising teenagers could really make something of themselves. Or so they say. In his follow-up to the critically acclaimed Blue, Pat Grant confirms his reputation as ""the Australian Mark Twain"" (Craig Thompson, author of Blankets and Habibi) with a page-turning graphic novel about economic inequality, desperation, and the gambler's addiction to hope even in the worst of times.

In 1835, New York newspaper The Sun published a series of six articles declaring the discovery of life--and even civilization--on the Moon, which the paper attributed to the famous contemporary astronomer Sir John Herschel. According to the Sun, the lunar inhabitants included unicorns, bison, bipedal tail-less beavers, and intelligent humanoids with bat-like wings. Life on the Moon is a full-length graphic novel capturing this mythical world. Creator Robert Grossman said the book is set in a time when ""many of the signal achievements of the 19th Century still lay well in the future, Andrew Jackson was president, the steamboat was the summit of technology, and news traveled slowly."" The unfettered novel includes real historical figures such as P.T. Barnum, Jean Jacques Audubon, Lorenzo Da Ponte, Charles Goodyear, and Edgar Allan Poe. Grossman stated that, ""Life on the Moon is meant to be at least partly funny, and has a rip-roaring sci-fi ending.""

Acclaimed suspense novelist and New York Times-bestselling author Joe Hill (The Fireman, Heart-Shaped Box, NOS4A2) has created a gripping story of dark fantasy and wonder--with astounding artwork from Gabriel Rodriguez--that, like the doors of Keyhouse, will transform all who open it. Following their father's gruesome murder in a violent home invasion, the Locke children return to his childhood home of Keyhouse in secluded Lovecraft, Massachusetts. Their mother, Nina, is too trapped in her grief--and a wine bottle--to notice that all in Keyhouse is not what it seems: too many locked doors, too many unanswered questions. Older kids Tyler and Kinsey aren't much better. But not youngest son Bode, who quickly finds a new friend living in an empty well and a new toy, a key, that offers hours of spirited entertainment. But again, all at Keyhouse is not what it seems, and not all doors are meant to be opened. Soon, horrors old and new, real and imagined, will come ravening after the Lockes and the secrets their family holds.

And the juxtapositions-good heavens! Sparks has been published in the New Yorker, the Wall Street Journal, and many other publications.

It's the greatest WHODUNIT of our time... or a new low for ""Presidential Harassment!"" Shannon Wheeler, Eisner Award-winning New Yorker cartoonist (Too Much Coffee Man, Sh*t My President Says, God is Disappointed in You), and veteran journalist Steve Duin (The Oregonian, Comics: Between the Panels, Oil and Water) turn their critical eye on the Mueller Report--a comprehensive, understandable, and readable graphic novel version of the book every patriot needs. Fight the spin spewing forth from both parties and political pulpits and check out this graphic novel that brings a 400-page legal document down to size. Wheeler and Duin, in graphic form, bring to life scenes detailed in the report: from the infamous Trump Tower Meeting of 2016 to Trump exclaiming ""I'm f*cked"" upon finding out he was the subject of investigation. It's in the report and it's in the graphic novel! The Mueller Report: Graphic Novel borrows style from classic private detective yarns, complete with a villainous rogues' gallery, nail-biting cliffhangers, and a lone lawman standing proud against the wave of crime. See Trump berate his Attorney General. Watch a petulant Commander-in-Chief lob insults at the White House counsel. Witness the ""witch hunt"" as it happened, cataloged as only the top lawman in the country could! This staggering laundry list of questionable contacts, misleading statements, unreported engagements, and possible coordination--enough to stun any student of the U.S. Constitution--is laid bare with a cold, satirical edge. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You may Tweet in anger. But most importantly, you will be reading the report for yourself! ",https://comicbookrealm.com/series/61411/0/idw-publishing-mueller-report

Set in Canada around 1920, Jesuit Joe is of French-Canadian and Mohawk origin and is engaged in an obsessive religious search for the absolute, as he moves through the snowy wastelands of the region. He wears the red jacket of the Canadian Mounted Police that he found in a hut-which gives rise to a series of misunderstandings when he is mistaken for a member of the force. His actions highlight his unusual ethical code and his disturbing and complex personality-he kills with terrible ease and shows an unmatched cruelty and ferocity, yet his mood suddenly shifts and he performs unexpected acts of kindness and compassion. All the while, he is tracked by his nemesis, Sergeant Fox, whose mission is to capture Jesuit Joe and bring him to justice. This is the first English language edition of Pratt's 1980 classic, and includes an incomplete second story of Jesuit Joe, plus Pratt's storyboards drawn for the movie version.

The book covers his first appearances on television, Graceland, his meeting with President Nixon, his wedding to Priscilla, and much more. Millions of fans loved him, purchased his records, attended his sold out shows and went to his thirty-three films. Death, forty years ago, has not diminished his fame. ""Elvis Lives!""

Mignola's iconic creation struck a meteoric chord with fans from the very start and has not abated in the 25-plus years since the character's debut. This Artisan Edition features the first five issues of Hellboy in Hell as well as a wealth of historic supplementary material: the first three Hellboy stories-the two initial four-pagers, produced for promotional purposes, and the 10-page story from John Byrne's Nextmen #21-plus The Corpse, and two other tales selected by Mignola for inclusion. Nearly every page has been scanned from Mignola's original art and showcases the artist's gorgeous work as closely as possible to the physical page-this is a book for fans of great storytelling and students of the craft. An Artisan Edition endeavors to mimic as closely as possible the experience of viewing the actual original art-for instance, corrections, blue pencils, paste-overs, all the little nuances that make original art unique.

It is arguably the most important graphic memoir ever created in comics. Carlos Giménez's autobiographical account of the plight of children in post-World War II Fascist Spain has won virtually every comics award in Europe, including 'Best Album' at the 1981 Angoulême Festival, and the 'Heritage Award' at Angoulême in 2010. In the late 1930s when Spanish fascists led by Franco, and aided by Hitler and Mussolini, overthrew the elected government, almost 200,000 men and women fell in battle, were executed, or died in prison. Their orphaned children-and others ripped from the homes of the defeated-were shuttled from Church-run 'home' to 'home' and fed a steady diet of torture and disinformation by a totalitarian state bent on making them 'productive' citizens. Carlos Giménez was one of those children. In 1975, after Franco's death, Carlos began to tell his story. Breaking the code of silence proved to be a milestone, both for the comics medium and for a country coming to terms with its past. An illustrated essay by Carmen Moreno-Nuño, Associate Professor of Hispanic Studies at the University of Kentucky, places the comics in historical perspective.

Activist organizing meets government gridlock as a millennial New Yorker cartoonist follows a first-year senator on her unforgettable journey -- from outsider to insider. In early 2018, cartoonist Sofia Warren was not paying attention to New York state politics. But that summer, her Brooklyn neighborhood began buzzing about Julia Salazar, a 27-year-old democratic socialist running for state senate whose grassroots campaign was inspiring an army of volunteers. When they beat the odds and won, Warren found herself wondering what would happen next. How does it work when an outsider who runs on revolutionary change has to actually do the job? So she decided to find out. Using the graphic memoir format, Radical: My Year with a Socialist Senator is a remarkable first-hand account of Warren's experience embedded with Julia Salazar and her staff during their first year in office. From candid conversations and eyewitness experiences, Warren builds a gripping and intimate portrait of a scrappy team of community organizers battling entrenched power structures, particularly to advance Julia's marquee issue of housing rights. At every key point during the year -- setting up an office, navigating insider politics, public pushback, testy staff meetings, emotional speeches, protest marches, setbacks, and victories -- Warren is up close and personal with Julia and her team, observing, questioning, and drawing, as they try to translate their ideals into concrete legislation. Along the way, Warren works toward answers to deeper questions: what makes a good leader? What does it mean to be a part of a community? Can democracy work? How can everyday people make change happen? All these themes are explored -- with nuance, compassion, and humor -- in Sofia Warren's remarkable debut.

They encounter hostility from both man and nature as they struggle through droughts and locusts in an attempt to cultivate the arid soil. When misery pushes them to the extreme, Malka's uncle is visited by the prophet Elias, who advises that he create a Golem-the mythical creature fashioned from earth and endowed with life by engraving on his body the word ""emet"" (""truth"")-to pose as a man and aid the immigrants.

Years later, when the adult Malka is visited by Elias, the events of her youth force her to decide whether or not she can maintain her silence-with fate and divine justice hanging in the balance.

In the other-dimensional Mirror Universe there is no United Federation of Planets, only a cruel Terran Empire, where advancement comes through assassination, brutality is commonplace, and kindness is a weakness. In Mirror Broken, the Terran Empire is on its last legs in its war with the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance, but Captain Jean-Luc Picard has learned of a final chance for victory: a revolutionary new Galaxy-class starship that could turn the tide of the war. The ship is called Enterprise--and Picard intends to take it. In Through The Mirror, when the Enterprise-D discovers a burned-out, pillaged Andorian vessel, the search for the culprits leads to some startlingly familiar faces. But, how did the Mirror Universe crew find their way to ours, and what does Emperor Spock have to do with it? Plus, it's interstellar espionage aboard the Enterprise-D when the Mirror Universe crew infiltrates Captain Picard's ship! And in Terra Incognita, the Enterprise crew returns to business as usual, little realizing the serpent in their midst--one of their own has been replaced! Six stories focusing on fan-favorite crew members of the Enterprise-D--including Deanna Troi, Wesley Crusher, and Selar--each connected by the machinations of this sinister doppelganger.

For 25 years - did we mention it's been 25 years? - Coverly's work has appeared in over 400 newspapers, including the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, and the Detroit Free Press, as well as in Parade magazine, textbooks, greeting cards, and even on that internet thingy. Heck, we bet some of your friends have even shared them on your social media platforms! And yeah, that uncredited cartoon you saw that one time on a B-list celeb's Facebook page? That was Dave's! Dave Barry has said of Coverly, ""He's very, very funny, AND he can draw. I hate him."" Which is nice, though it does explain the lack of invitations to the Barry's summer home. Dry and gentle not only describes Dave's hands, but his sense of humor as well. And while there are no guarantees in life, this new collection of Speed Bump cartoons hopes to make you think, smile, snort awkwardly, rethink, pause for a bathroom break, maybe get a second cup of coffee, and return to read a few more before realizing you really should be doing something a little more productive.

High Councilor Halogen addresses the disappearance of Autobot leader Sentinel Prime, of which the former Kaonian industrial worker-turned-gladiator Megatron stands accused of orchestrating. Megatron is asked to step forward. One of the Council inquires him of his name, and Megatron begins his testimony. Megatron explains his origins as a nameless laborer, known only by his assigned sector number, D-16. He reveals how he became intrigued by witnessing and participating in gladiatorial combat for the first time. It was here where he discovered the value of free will and equality among Cybertronians, and how the lower classes of the caste system were in constant oppression by the higher classes. In these combat pits, Megatron saw the potential for all forms of Cybertronian life, regardless of social status, and thus defends his right to his name and to be heard. After his testimony, another Councilor questions his involvement in recent terrorist activity, such as the capture of Sentinel Prime and the attacks on Six Lasers Over Cybertron, the Blaster City Armaments Plant, and Polyhex's Smelting Pool Estates. The one's responsible for such attacks call themselves ""Decepticons"" and claim to be followers of Megatron. Megatron brushes off the accusations, but speaks his admiration of these ""Decepticons"" since, to him, sometimes deception is a necessary evil to overcome a greater evil, such as the hindrance of free expression for all. High Councilor Sigil speaks on behalf of the Guilds of Cybertron, reiterating how the castes system and the guilds have kept Cybertron civilization in order for eons, as Primus himself decrees, and describes how any individual plotting to undermine such a peaceful status (such as Megatron) as being a radical and one who speaks of treason. Halogen calls forth the young Hall of Records data clerk Orion Pax to speak. Orion Pax steps forward and addresses all that Megatron has addressed. He explains how, while all the recent attacks and uprisings were harsh and intolerable, they are only signs of their failing civilization. As long as the guilds and the caste remain in effect, the current situation of Cybertron will only get worse, with each Cybertronian voice wanting to be heard. And what's more, it is only natural for such feelings of free expression to exist within the sparks of all Cybertronians. But as long as order dominates over freedom, Orion declares, ""There can be no true peace through tyranny!"" Orion Pax calls for the need for a new leader, a new Prime. One who who would recognize each person as his own unique individual, his own autonomous robot. Orion reaffirms that all Cybertronians are Autonomous Robots, and from that coins the term ""Autobots"", using it as the name for a new movement based on freedom and equal individuality. He again calls for the choosing of a new Prime, and rallies many supporters in the room for his Autobot movement. Halogen, however, calls for order and silences the room. He then speaks of having come to realize the stagnation of their planet's way of life, and agrees that a new leader must be chosen to prevent their planet from collapsing into war. But, this new Prime must first find the lost Matrix of Leadership, which, according to the Archivist Alpha Trion, may yet lead Cybertron to a new golden era. If he can find it, Orion Pax may rightfully claim the Matrix, and Halogen promptly names him the new Prime: Optimus Prime. The newly rechristianed Optimus Prime attempts to decline the power that has been bestowed upon him, feeling unworthy of such an honor. Megatron however, see this promotion as an act of betrayal on Orion's part. Megatron accuses Optimus of having used him and his charisma to better his own image so that he, not Megatron, may take the title of Prime for himself. Optimus denies his assertions and tries to appeal to Megatron by reaffirming his beliefs in a free Cybertron and how, in its darkest hour, Cybertron will find and choose someone to lead it to a new age. Megatron scoffs at these words, further accusing Optimus of having fallen in with the High Council's ways, which he will openly defy and lead the Decepticons against in full retaliation. Elsewhere, Sentinel Prime stands battered and beaten, chained up in darkness between two pillers. Halogen attempts to silence Megtron, who swiftly and permanently silences Halogen with a blast from his newly revealed Fusion cannon. As the guards attempt to defend their new Prime, Optimus orders them to stand down. Seeing Optimus using his new authority reinvigorates Megatron's accusations. He warns Optimus that his gladiators would not back down as easily as the guards did, even if Optimus were now a Prime. Optimus is not intimidated, and Megatron orders his Decepticons to stand down as well. Megatron then warns Optimus of how many Decepticons await him out in the rest of the world, but Optimus remains prepared to face whatever challenges he may face. Megatron also looks forward facing whatever Autobots may oppose him, and vows to claim the Matrix for himself. As the Decepticons vacate the premises, the two former brothers say their farewells.

That means it's time for Bobo Del Rey, Wynonna's old enemy, to step up his plans on a breakout to free his brother. It's family against family as the Earp clan and the Del Reys go head-to-head in a rip-roaring, knock-down, drag out fight to escape the Bad Day at Black Rock.

Wood also became a star of EC’s satire comic called Mad, which went on to even greater success as a magazine, allowing the artist to apply his amazing talents in a broader spectrum. When the comics industry fell on lean times during the mid 1950s, Wood segued into the field of science fiction pulp illustration, providing over 200 beautiful drawings and several color cover paintings for the digest magazines; particularly Galaxy. Wood left behind a legacy of great art, much of which has never been reprinted. This book will feature them all. Long time Wally Wood historian Roger Hill has spent the past twenty years pulling together the history of Wood’s involvement with the pulp digests and tracking down original art for this project.

A burnt out filmmaker finds new inspiration behind the wheel of an iconic New York City taxi cab, exploring a world where he is the stranger and the city his new workplace. After 20 years working on film and series shoots, Benoît Cohen is drained. His enthusiasm gone, a desire to stop writing and put down the camera takes over. In the city for a year, he still wonders about how best to absorb the rich diversity of the cosmopolitan metropolis, settling on a simple idea: he will become a taxi driver. Behind the iconic Yellow Cab, behind the fantasy of freedom and independence, behind the faces of his thousands of passengers, Benoît discovers a world in which he is a stranger. First, the administrative maze that leads to the taxi driver's license. Then the world behind the scenes. And, finally, the prejudices that surround the profession and lead the customers, cops and entire city to look at it, quite randomly, either with indifference, kindness, or aggression. Benoît Cohen dives into his new life with the idea of turning it into a screenplay for a future film, but the material he collects from this social experiment marks him deeply, leading down unsuspected paths. The project transforms into an autobiographical novel interspersed with reflections on the creative process. With the help of Chabouté, it is now a sensitive, deeply human graphic novel, with breathtaking illustrations that pay vibrant tribute to the most famous of American cities.

A woman awakens on an alien planet with no memory of her previous existence. She begins a quest to survive, relying on her wits, skills, and instincts to adapt to an inhospitable environment. After months barely surviving, she discovers a mysterious spacecraft at the bottom of a frozen lake. She dredges it, only to discover a blurred holographic image and distorted messages. She repairs the craft and journeys across the galaxy but what is the ship’s destination, and who are the messages from?

Then, Mark Russell (Flintstones) joins forces with virtuoso artist Adam Pollina (Whalesville) for a tale of friendship and adventure in the far future.

Cyrus Garvey couldn’t believe his luck: If he agreed to attend a timeshare presentation, he’d get a free transporter trip anywhere in the galaxy. And those things are expensive! Cy sat through the hour long presentation at Last Resorts Inc, passed on the timeshare, but took the vacation, and man was it a blast. A few days later, Cy’s friend gets the same invitation, but she’s reluctant to go she can’t say no to a salesman. Cy agrees to sit through the presentation under her name, and she’s cool, as long as they can take a trip together.

Cy shows up to the presentation, takes a seat in the back and prepares to run out the clock on the hour, but is surprised to find a familiar face giving the sales presentation is…himself?!

Surely Last Resorts Inc., didn’t take Cy’s DNA from the transporter and clone him? Surely they didn’t build a bunch of clones as slave labor…and surely Cy didn’t agree to this in the fine print. Man, all Cy wanted was to get away for a few days… ",https://comicbookrealm.com/series/68256/0/bad-idea-comics-refuse-x-last-resorts-one-shot

No sign of deer all day. But just as their patience is about to give, they spot it. On the ridge. A deer. Shooting game on a ridge is strictly forbidden -- no telling where it might fall. But Bobby's father insists. They've waited all day and, after all, it's Christmas. How could they know the deer peeking over the ridge was...a reindeer? How could they know it was part of a group harnessed together pulling a sleigh? How could they know they were going to kill Old Saint Nick's beautiful baby boys? They run. They hide. But it doesn't matter. The quiet peace of this quaint Midwestern farming hamlet will soon be shattered because Santa Claus knows that they’ve been naughty, and he's coming to town to maim, kill and magically murder them all.

It's a Santa-sized Bad Idea one-shot, written by Emmy Award winner Zeb Wells (Hellions, Robot Chicken) and illustrated by artistic all-star David Lafuente (Ultimate Spider-Man) with colors by the incredible Ulises Arreola (Action Comics) that is destined to go down in infamy!

Celebrating the 25th anniversary of the TV series in 2020! Everything you want to know about Captain Kathryn Janeway's Starship Voyager and crew. The perfect holiday gift for the Star Trek fan in your life! STAR TREK: VOYAGER was groundbreaking. It was the first STAR TREK show with a female captain and had the franchise's most diverse cast. It pushed the boundaries of visual effects and makeup further than ever before, and literally took the show into new territory when Voyager was stranded in the Delta Quadrant, home of the Borg Collective. STAR TREK: VOYAGER - A CELEBRATION tells the behind-the-scenes story of Voyager's epic journey, from its earliest origins and pivotal episodes to in- depth features on writing, directing, visual effects, production art and more. This is the ultimate guide to the making of a television classic. It is based on more than 30 new interviews, featuring the nine principal cast members, including Kate Mulgrew, Jeri Ryan, and Robert Picardo, and key behind-the-scenes personnel who reveal the stories and secrets behind the show. STAR TREK: VOYAGER first appeared on TV on 16 January 1995, running for 172 episodes over seven seasons. Charting the adventures of the 24th Century Starfleet Vessel U.S.S. Voyager, this multi award-winning series followed the starship and its crew to the distant side of the galaxy. Celebrating 25 years since its first broadcast episode, this book explores the very best of STAR TREK: VOYAGER, with chapters looking at the greatest episodes, alien characters, visual effects, hair and makeup, costumes and guest stars. Plus the actors talk of their memories of the show, and recall their personal highlights over its six-and-a-half year run.

Their origin stories, rivalries, and sheer genius, as Reid Mitenbuler skillfully relates, were as colorful and subversive as their creations - from Felix the Cat to Bugs Bunny to feature films such as Fantasia - which became an integral part and reflection of American culture over the next five decades. Wild Minds is an ode to our colorful past and to the creative energy that later inspired The Simpsons, South Park, and BoJack Horseman.

A young man wakes up in the hospital to discover that one of his arms has been amputated. Then a portrait on the wall of his hospital room begins to speak to him. The subject of the painting introduces himself as Ambroise Paré, the French barber-surgeon who revolutionized the art of amputation. From this wonderfully absurd premise, the two begin an imaginary conversation that takes them through a sweeping history of surgical amputation, from the Stone Age to the Space Age. Unencumbered by pathos or didacticism, this graphic novel explores a number of topics surrounding amputation, revealing fascinating details about famous amputees throughout history, the invention of the tourniquet, phantom limb syndrome, types of prostheses, and transhumanist technologies. Playfully illustrated and seriously funny, The Body Factory is sure to delight anyone interested in the history, or the future, of medicine. From early prostheses to present-day transhumanism, this graphic novel addresses one of the most remarkable challenges in the history of medicine: how we repair and even enhance the body.

In 1972, the American oil company Texaco--subsequently merged with Chevron--extracted its first barrel of crude oil from Amazonian Ecuador. By the time it pulled out of the region some twenty years later, Texaco had extracted oil from at least three hundred wells and left behind nearly sixteen million gallons of spilled oil and more than eighteen million gallons of toxic waste. In Crude, Ecuadorian lawyer and activist Pablo Fajardo gives a firsthand account of Texaco's involvement in the Amazon, as well as the ensuing legal battles between the oil company, the Ecuadorian government, and the region's inhabitants. As a teenager, Fajardo worked in the Amazonian oil fields, where he witnessed the consequences of Texaco/Chevron's extraction work there--the pools of waste that polluted the land and waterways, contaminated food sources, and caused cancers, birth defects, and deaths. Fajardo mobilized with his peers to seek reparations and studied to become a lawyer.

The COVID 19 pandemic brought the world to its knees. Sheltering in place, we watched in horror as medical personnel worked around the clock to care for the sick and dying. We were advised to self-quarantine, wash our hands, wear a mask, and practice social distancing. Businesses were shuttered, travel stopped, workers were furloughed, and markets dropped. Yet people continued to die. Amid all this uncertainty, writers and artists from around the world continued to create comics - many commenting directly on how individuals, societies, and governments, employers, and other institutions reacted to the worldwide crisis. COVID Chronicles: A Comics Anthology collects more than forty such short comics in which creators tell stories about working from home, virtual homeschooling, and the fear of grocery shopping. They probe the failures of government leaders and the social safety net. And they dig in to the racial bias and systemic inequities that this pandemic helped bring to light. We see what it's like to get the virus--and to live to tell about it, or to stand by helplessly as a loved-one passes. At times heartbreaking and at others hopeful and humorous, these comics express the anger, anxiety, fear, and bewilderment we feel in the era of COVID-19. Above all, they highlight the power of art and community to help us make sense of a world in crisis, reminding us that we are truly all in this together.

What is sex? Has it always existed? What purpose does it serve? Why are there penises and vaginas? These questions are at the very core of Dirty Biology, an erudite (and hilarious) graphic novel that aims to teach you everything you wanted to know about sex--and then some. ""Sex"" can mean a number of things. It can refer to sex organs, to sex types, to the act of copulation, or to the simple exchange of genetic material. This book explains what we actually mean when we talk about sex and reveals a wealth of astonishing scientific details along the way. For example, did you know that some species can have sex without genitals? And when it comes to genitals, did you know that there's an amazing diversity of these across species? From the evolution of penises and vaginas to far-fetched mating rituals and the shocking consequences of the sex act, Dirty Biology exposes sex for what it is: a lot more interesting and more complicated than the simplistic image we often have of it.

Gila, 26, was at a party when the police showed up. The men were able to get away with bribes, but the women were taken to the station, and anyone who’d been drinking was forced to submit to a virginity test. She never went to another party after that.

Zeinab is 20 and she loves being a woman in Iran. She says that she feels like a queen! And despite all the risks, she confesses that she makes love with her boyfriend because the danger excites her.

Vahid is 26. He was a leader with the Green Movement. Then he watched his friend Neda die right in front of him. Now he keeps his head down, trying to finish his studies.

In a series of vignettes based on clandestine interviews, this award-winning graphic novel explores the politics and love lives of ten young Iranian men and women from diverse backgrounds. The result is an honest portrait of Iranian youth today and a rare glimpse into a society where the sexes are strictly segregated―and Western journalists aren’t welcome. Through testimonies from across the country, we learn about traditional marriages, the pressures of living under the regime, and how young people escape the police and defy tradition to live their love stories.

Twelve-year-old Adel and his cousin Shafi try to lead a normal childhood in war-torn Afghanistan. But when Adel's father dies, everything changes. His uncle, a religious fundamentalist, sends Adel to study at a madrasa run by militants, where he is trained as an insurgent and chosen to carry out a suicide bombing. When his moment of martyrdom arrives, Adel's detonator fails, and he is forced to flee the country or risk being killed by the Afghan police or the Taliban themselves. Together, Adel and Shafi set out to seek refuge in England, where Shafi's brother now lives and where a new life awaits. With that hope, the two boys begin the perilous journey of 6,000 miles to freedom, crossing mountains on foot and squeezing into crowded trucks with other refugees. The two become separated only to find each other again in the Calais Jungle encampment, their last, hellish stop.

In 1994, at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, MK Czerwiec took her first nursing job, at Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Chicago, as part of the caregiving staff of HIV/AIDS Care Unit 371. Taking Turns pulls back the curtain on life in the ward. A shining example of excellence in the treatment and care of patients, Unit 371 was a community for thousands of patients and families affected by HIV and AIDS and the people who cared for them. This graphic novel combines Czerwiec's memories with the oral histories of patients, family members, and staff. It depicts life and death in the ward, the ways the unit affected and informed those who passed through it, and how many look back on their time there today. Czerwiec joined Unit 371 at a pivotal time in the history of AIDS: deaths from the syndrome in the Midwest peaked in 1995 and then dropped drastically in the following years, with the release of antiretroviral protease inhibitors. This positive turn of events led to a decline in patient populations and, ultimately, to the closure of Unit 371. Czerwiec's restrained, inviting drawing style and carefully considered narrative examine individual, institutional, and community responses to the AIDS epidemic--as well as the role that art can play in the grieving process. Deeply personal yet made up of many voices, this history of daily life in a unique AIDS care unit is an open, honest look at suffering, grief, and hope among a community of medical professionals and patients at the heart of the epidemic.

The narrative medium is the comic strip, applied here “to increase popular interest in geology,” as one of its original contributors described the project. An enormously popular feature in the West Texas newspaper where it had originated more than fifty years ago, The Ancient Southwest has been painstakingly restored and annotated by the cartoonist and cultural historian Michael H. Price as a follow-through to a lengthy collaboration with the primary artist, the late George E. Turner. The strips, originally designed for serialized weekly publication, have gone unseen since 1951–1952. Inspired by the permanent collections of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum in Canyon, Texas, the cartoons cover a vast span of prehistory, from the earliest invertebrate and reptilian life to the Age of Mammals and the Paleo-Indians. The volume also contains a full restoration of Turner’s The Palo Duro Story, recounting one of the earliest Spanish explorations of North America from the viewpoint of Cabeza de Vaca. An appendix reproduces a selection of Turner’s college-newspaper cartoons of the post-WWII years, foreshadowing the style he would bring to bear upon The Ancient Southwest and The Palo Duro Story.

This graphic novel biography is the story of Soviet Jewry ""refusenik"" and human rights activist Anatoly ""Natan"" Sharansky. Born in 1948 to a Jewish family in Ukraine, at that time part of the Soviet Union, he was arrested as a young man and later imprisoned for wanting to leave the Soviet Union and go to Israel. His struggle became the struggle of all Soviet Jews who wished to leave. With the help of his wife, many Jewish activists, and world leaders, he eventually succeeded in immigrating to Israel, paving the way for the release of other Soviet Jews who wished to live in freedom.

The Grid is a mystical nexus, a crossroads connecting all times and all realities. Along the ley lines of the Grid, the multiverse clusters. To move along the Grid is to move from one reality to the next. To harness the power of the Grid is to harness the awesome might of creation. Five touchstone realities exist at focal points along the Grid. From each of these realities, a Warlock is chosen to act as one of five Guardians. Savasthar, a shapeshifting dragon-like being. Doomidor, a warlord from the Dark Ages. Argon, an advanced cybernetic organism from a techno-hell. Tanith, an ageless sorceress. Zania, a power-mad, machine gun necromancer. Together, the Warlocks protect the Grid, thereby protecting all of space and time. They are the last line of defense against the awful forces of chaos that lurk in the darkness outside the Grid. There's only one problem. They hate each other. ",https://comicbookrealm.com/series/70226/0/comics-experience-publishing-warlock-5-the-omnibus

Featuring Miss Lace

When World War II began, master cartoonist Milton Caniff created a newspaper strip for military newspapers only. Called MALE CALL, it featured GI's sweetheart, Miss Lace,. Circulated to 3,000 camp papers, it offered a breath of humor and hint of sex in a world at war. Now, in this deluxe collection, see what 15 million GI's followed each week from 1042 to 1046. Included are the strips the US military censored, Milton Caniff himself talking about the times and the reasons MALE CALL was created, and a special Foreword by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Bill Mauldin, creator of UP FRONT with Willie and Joe.

Jens Harder takes the reader on an operatic journey from the beginning with the nano-seconds following the Big Bang through the next 14 billion years. We see our infant universe as it rapidly expands, formed by black holes belonging to other universes. He uses a cinematic style to show ever step, to take readers through the formation of our solar system and the Earth itself, charting the long course of biological evolution.

Kunnas chronicles the band from Ringo's birth (against a backdrop of the Luftwaffe shelling Liverpool) through the release of their hit, 'Please Please Me'/'Ask Me Why.' Focusing on the band's pre-fame days in a sly and irreverent style (and not shying away from Brian Epstein's fixation upon John), Kunnas makes liberal use of corny in-jokes and hokey wordplay, but it's all done in good fun.

Ron English tells the story of Delusionville, a world where animals have different social status based on their species. This is Ron English's magnum opus, a subversive rock opera, featuring Ronnnie Rabbbit, A surreal cast of characters populates this paradise, including buzzards, pigs, sheep, turtles, ducks, wolves, and the ""rabbbits"" who are caught in the middle of all the insanity that is Delusionville. Ronnnie, the main rabbbit, is the only animal who tries to accept all contradictory belief systems, which has driven him completely insane. A collection of over 100 images set with lyrics. Greetings from Delusionville is a deluxe oversized hardcover coffee table book. ""Rabbbits in Delusionville"" is a rock opera that is like post-factual Animal Farm meets Aesop's Fables on LSD. Delusionville tells the story of a society that formed as different animals fell down a rabbbit hole and created a world with their own mythologies, religion, and politics. Every animal group represents an embedded archetype in the social structure that is about to come in question. This is largely a commentary on faux news, stagnation of social mobility, and downright delusional thinking. It is an opera in three acts: Act One - Introduces all of the characters in Delusionville and brings into question the nature of their society and their various places in the social order. Act Two - The animals get riled up about the economic disparity and social injustice in their previously unquestioned world of delusion. Act Three - A very unusual take on revolution.

The book is headlined by a savage depiction of the implications of the melting polar ice cap in Antarctica, by award-winning cartoonist/illustrator William Stout, who provides the cover. Also included is work by Richard Corben, Rick Veitch, Drew Friedman, Bryan Talbot, Hunt Emerson, Peter Kuper, and many more, as well as unseen work by the late, great Greg Irons.

One of three customizable comic books offered by The LEGO Group for the 2021 Comic-Con At Home. The first 10,000 North American users of the LEGO Comic Creator who requested it received a printed issue of their comic as well as the .pdf version available to all users.

Customization involved naming and designing a LEGO character by selecting options from menus for Skin, Face, Hair (with color options for some choices), Torso and Legs. Once finished, the user selected one of the three comic books available and responded to a series of questions by choosing a word or phrase for incorporation into the character's speech.

The selections were then inserted into specific panels that did not alter the story presented in the remaining panels of the comic. The LEGO figure designed was also shown on the cover of the issue.

Individual issues were mailed within a folded, double-width backing board inside customized envelopes that noted ""A custom made comic inside."" Each envelope also displayed the name and an illustration of the customized LEGO figure featured in the enclosed comic.

NOTE: Each customized issue is individually numbered. The numbering of this series is shared with the two other series available for the 2021 Comic-Con At Home, Spider-Man: Home Invasion and LEGO Star Wars Commemorative Edition! Escape from Cloud City. A total of 10000 issues of the three series combined were printed, but because the printed issues were limited to three per address and were also available in .pdf format, not all numbers 1-10000 were printed and printed issues with numbers above 10000 may exist.

One of three customizable comic books offered by The LEGO Group for the 2021 Comic-Con At Home. The first 10,000 North American users of the LEGO Comic Creator who requested it received a printed issue of their comic as well as the .pdf version available to all users.

Customization involved naming and designing a LEGO character by selecting options from menus for Skin, Face, Hair (with color options for some choices), Torso and Legs. Once finished, the user selected one of the three comic books available and responded to a series of questions by choosing a word or phrase for incorporation into the character's speech.

The selections were then inserted into specific panels that did not alter the story presented in the remaining panels of the comic. The LEGO figure designed was also shown on the cover of the issue.

Individual issues were mailed within a folded, double-width backing board inside customized envelopes that noted ""A custom made comic inside."" Each envelope also displayed the name and an illustration of the customized LEGO figure featured in the enclosed comic.

NOTE: Each customized issue is individually numbered. The numbering of this series is shared with the two other series available for the 2021 Comic-Con At Home, Spider-Man: Home Invasion and LEGO Star Wars Commemorative Edition! Escape from Cloud City. A total of 10000 issues of the three series combined were printed, but because the printed issues were limited to three per address and were also available in .pdf format, not all numbers 1-10000 were printed and printed issues with numbers above 10000 may exist. The total number of printed issues of each individual series is unknown. ",https://comicbookrealm.com/series/68750/0/lego-systems-lego-spider-man-home-invasion-one-shot

Izzy Crane is new to Sleepy Hollow, and already sick of the town's hokey obsession with Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.
She has no time for superstition with a new school, a new home, and a new crush on Vicky Van Tassel, AKA the town's teen royalty, descended from one of the families featured in the famous old story.
When it turns out that the Headless Horseman might be more than just a story though, it's up to Izzy, Vicky, and class clown Oscar to uncover a sinister, centuries old plot... and they've only got 'til Halloween to put a stop to it!

Millions were sent to their deaths in pointless battles. The Italian Front stretched along the borders of Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empires, in treacherous mountain regions. In the last months of 1916, a private in the Italian Bersaglieri returns to his childhood home in the Trentino mountain range to find it no longer a place of adventure and wonder as it was in his youth, but a place of death and despair. Amongst the weapons of both armies, none is more feared than the White Death: thundering avalanches deliberately caused by cannon fire... which, like war itself, consumes everything in their path.

Benjamin Dewey's popular online comic is finally compiled in one collection for your melancholy-tinged enjoyment! The Tragedy Series is comprised of more than 500 sepia-toned vignettes that present those less than rosy paths available to us all. From such heartrending examples of schadenfreude as 'triceratops never got to see the ocean' and 'taxidermist and necromancer make bad roommates' to the necessary morale-boost of 26 'sadness reprieves,' all of life's peaks and valleys are accounted for. One part Victoriana, one part theatre of the absurd, and the rest full of heart, these illustrations delight the mind and the eye.

—————

""Major Inapak, Space Ace"" – (13-page story) – The Master Rocketeer relates a story to children. In 1982, just as the East and West blocs were about to attack each other from space, Earth was threatened from the Moon. Robin stowed away in a repurposed attack rocket in which Major Inapak was sent to investigate. They found the Earth under attack from a previously unknown planet, hidden behind the Moon. With the help of a friendly lunar creature they reversed the planet-destroying weapon, wiping out the attackers, and returned to Earth.

""Science Sidelights"" – (3-page story) – Major Inapak demonstrates several household science experiments, wrapping up with a promotion for Inapak.

Bridging the gap between Once Upon a Hard Time and A Ragged Return to Lonely Street, this stand alone story reveals the adventure the Goon (along with several other mysterious figures) found himself entangled in after he departed the Nameless Town. The Lords of Misery... a mysterious organization made up (unwillingly) by history's most notorious dregs. Through the ages they have battled an enigmatic and unstoppable force. A being whose evil makes the Lord's crimes look downright petty in comparison. Always it returns after a long hibernation. And always the Lords have died trying to thwart it. But if generations of Lords haven't been able to stop it, what chance does the Goon and this current incarnation have?

From creator Thom Zahler, known for his work on Love and Capes, Long Distance, Warning Label, Time & Vine, and My Little Pony comes his latest Rom Com, Cupid's Arrows. When Rick and Lora say they’ve been colleagues for a long time, they mean it. For over 200 years, these partners have roamed the mortal world as real-life cupids • magic-wielding foot soldiers on the battlefront of love. Now it’s the 21st century, and Rick and Lora are facing their most challenging case ever: bringing together a Type-A, career-driven woman and a former football player-cum-barista who couldn’t be more different. The pair is perfect for each other (even if they don’t know it yet) so the cupids will have to make sure their love arrows land, and do it all while they face their own unrequited feelings for one another. Will love win the day? “A heartfelt cross between MEN IN BLACK by way of MOONLIGHTING with a love tap from WINGS OF DESIRE, CUPID'S ARROWS is Thom Zahler's funny Valentine to comics.” -- creator Dean Haspiel ""Charm, wit, and heart are the hallmarks of Thom Zahler's work - and Cupid's Arrows has an abundance of all three qualities!"" -- J. M. DeMatties ""An imaginative, enchanting, and, yes, romantic urban fantasy that ushers you in to a fascinating world, a compelling story, and to absolutely charming leads.

""Psycho"" traumatized viewers around the world. Never before had the angst or the suspense been so well presented in cinema. But where does the talent of this Alfred Hitchcock come from, the one nicknamed the Master of Suspense? To find out, we must first go back to his youth, in England, during the first half of the 20th century. Having grown up in a Catholic family - a religious originality that will be felt in a large part of his cinema - ""Hitch"" is an atypical Englishman who, very early on, has a taste for telling chilling stories. The temptation to work for the cinema will not be long in coming, first as a graphic designer where his visual talent will lead him to make his debut behind the camera, as an assistant and then as a full director. It is also here that he will meet Alma Reville, his assistant and wife who will accompany him throughout his storied career, including the jump to the big time in Hollywood. Discover the life of undoubtedly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, the in-depth story film by film, with plenty of juicy anecdotes and amazing insights from interviews with Francois Truffaut and others, of a colorful and quite simply extraordinary artist.

Django Reinhardt is a legend. But Django -which may have meant ""I awake""- was twice born. A first time in the snow, during the winter of 1910 in a nomadic gypsy family stationed in Liberchies, Belgium. The second in Saint-Ouen, near Paris, in the fall of 1928, when a fire in his caravan mutilated his left hand. Writer Salva Rubio and artist Efa have already produced together a remarkable biopic on Monet, paying tribute to the painter's obsession with light. Likewise, this biopic devoted to the youth of the prodigy musician features the passion and determination of the man who has always considered himself the greatest guitarist in the world. In this story-score, by laying out the panels like chords, the artist brings to life his passion in vibrating watercolor to better accompany the musical and technical development of the inventor of gypsy jazz. From musette to jazz, from violin to banjo then to guitar, Django's destiny is that of his 'hand on fire', possessed by the supernatural spirit of the ""duende"" which burns in the soul of each gypsy musician.

The result of two years of elaboration and work, this space opera exemplifies his talent in two areas that he masters to perfection: the universe of science fiction and art. To build his story and compose his boards, Levallois draws from the painted and drawn work of the Renaissance master, selecting a large number of drawings and paintings by Leonardo to represent the characters, vessels or even the architectures in his story.

A biography in comics of the amazing rock singer Janis Joplin with the highlights of her journey from childhood after the Second World War to her abrupt death in late 1970. It is one of the most fabulous musical adventures in America of the second half of the twentieth century. Yet it lasted only five years. How did a very young messed up woman, a drug addict filled with doubt, become in a few years a planetary icon of rock music? Thanks to a worldwide movement of emancipation which would consecrate for a long time the ideals and modes of alternative lifestyles from counterculture to the flower power generation, Janis, the ugly duckling, gave free rein to her impulses. Fed by the thirst for freedom of the Beat Generation and the desire for emancipation expressed by American youth in the early 1960s, Janis Joplin left for San Francisco, the epicenter of cultural innovation. There, she abandons herself to all impulses, overcoming without hesitation all the taboos of the time: bisexuality, alcohol, drugs, doing so not only with delight, but with the taste for excess which came naturally from her spontaneous character. A lively, fascinating story of a woman ahead of her time. ",https://comicbookrealm.com/series/67922/0/nbm-love-me-please-the-story-of-janis-joplin

Scripts",,"Make no mistake, this is a violent and controversial piece, a pre-Civil War horror story that tackles head-on the gruesome and deplorable effects of slavery and racial hatred in American history. The first chapter, illustrated in a style akin to horror maestro Berni Wrightson, is a horrific sequence depicting the brutalization of a black woman by a pack of white outlaws, and it pulls no punches. But that is only the beginning, as the repercussions of that animalistic act resonate throughout the community, and soon a powerful force for revenge is out to claim the lives of the men involved. With graphic violence, raw sexual content and racially charged subject matter, this tale of terror is not your run-of-the-mill campfire ghost story, but it is an example of a creator pushing the boundaries of the medium to recall a shameful time in our nations history. Not for the squeamish. ",https://comicbookrealm.com/series/29370/0/northstar-publications-boots-of-the-oppressor-one-shot

He was carrying information from a source in the East - a list that allegedly contains the name of every espionage agent working in Berlin, on all sides. No list was found on his body. Now Lorraine Broughton, an experienced spy with no pre-existing ties to Berlin, has been sent into this powderkeg of social unrest, counter-espionage, defections gone bad and secret assassinations to bring back the list and save the lives of the British agents whose identities reside on it.

She’s begun feeling pressure to conform to a specific idea of beauty, body type, and a personality that just doesn’t fit. Val meets Kat, a smart, witty girl that doesn’t take any crap off anyone. Kat introduces Val to punk rock. Along with Rudie, another new friend, the three form an all-girl punk band they ironically name The Proper Ladies. Soon Val and her friends find themselves caught up in a movement with other girls also starting bands - also finding their voice. Collectively, these “riot grrrls” discover that their songs ring out loud and powerful, and for Val, there’s no going back. ",https://comicbookrealm.com/series/61845/0/oni-press-my-riot

This book is for anyone who wants to learn about asexuality, and for Ace people themselves, to validate their experiences. Asexuality is often called The Invisible Orientation. You don’t learn about it in school, you don’t hear “ace” on television. So, it’s kinda hard to be ace in a society so steeped in sex that no one knows you exist. Too many young people grow up believing that their lack of sexual desire means they are broken • so writer Molly Muldoon and cartoonist Will Hernandez, both in the ace community, are here to shed light on society’s misconceptions of asexuality and what being ace is really like. This book is for anyone who wants to learn about asexuality, and for Ace people themselves, to validate their experiences. Asexuality is a real identity and it’s time the world recognizes it.

Two sidekicks on opposite sides get stuck in an underground lab together, and find a great way to pass the time. A tactician and superhero discuss their desires, limits, and kinks before their first time, and perhaps get a little too excited in the process. A pair of supervillains explore gender and sex together, while growing closer in their relationship. Lesbian heroes try out a kinky roleplaying scenario, and discover how to make it work for both of them. And an exhausted assassin relaxes after a long day with the kind (yet firm) attentions of his husband.
Told with care, sex-positivity, and humor, and featuring a wide variety of sexualities and bodies, Super Fun Sexy Times aims to create an erotic reading experience that lives up to its name! ",https://comicbookrealm.com/series/57634/0/oni-press-super-fun-sexy-times

Join Greta and Minette once more for the heartwarming conclusion of the award-winning Tea Dragon series! Over a year since being entrusted with Ginseng's care, Greta still can't chase away the cloud of mourning that hangs over the timid Tea Dragon. As she struggles to create something spectacular enough to impress a master blacksmith in search of an apprentice, she questions the true meaning of crafting, and the true meaning of caring for someone in grief. Meanwhile, Minette receives a surprise package from the monastery where she was once training to be a prophetess. Thrown into confusion about her path in life, the shy and reserved Minette finds that the more she opens her heart to others, the more clearly she can see what was always inside. Told with the same care and charm as the previous installments of the Tea Dragon series, The Tea Dragon Tapestry welcomes old friends and new into a heartfelt story of purpose, love, and growth.

Jack Brennan is a Marine Corps sergeant whose infantry squad has been cleared to return home from a grueling deployment to Afghanistan. A few years prior, Sergeant Brennan lost one of his closest friends - a young combat veteran - to suicide and has vowed to do everything in his power to keep his Marines from a similar fate. On their last night in-country, Brennan shares his version of The Odyssey to help prepare his squad for the transition back to the home front. By retelling Homer's epic about Odysseus' difficult journey home after the Trojan War, and weaving in the stories of contemporary Marines, The Odyssey of Sergeant Jack Brennan powerfully conveys the profound challenges today's veterans face upon returning from combat even as it tells 'the oldest war story of all time.'

David Heatley had an unquestionably troubled and eccentric childhood: father a sexually repressed alcoholic, mother an overworked compulsive overeater. Then David's parents enter the world of 12-step programs and find a sense of support and community. It seems to help. David, meanwhile, grows up struggling with his own troublesome sexual urges and seeking some way to make sense of it all. Eventually he starts attending meetings too. Alcoholics Anonymous. Overeaters Anonymous. Debtors Anonymous. Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous. More and more meetings. Meetings for issues he doesn't have. With stark, sharply drawn art and unflinching honesty, David Heatley explores the strange and touching relationships he develops, and the truths about himself and his family he is forced to confront, while ""working"" an ever-increasing number of programs. The result is a complicated, unsettling, and hilarious journey--of far more than 12 steps. ",https://comicbookrealm.com/series/58162/0/pantheon-books-qualification-a-graphic-memoir-in-twelve-steps
